Implemented DFS and BFS algorithms using Stacks and Queues to solve the static maze. Of the two DFS is a better choice since it consumes much less memory space and will reach the goal node in a less period than BFS if it traverses in the right path. Unlike BFS it does not require extra memory space to store the nodes at every branch, which can be very high in problems like finding a path in a maze with higher dimensions.
